# VBA-challenge

I had a meeting session with my tutor and they helped me figure out this section of my code

                  ' Check for Max and Min values
                    If PercentageChange > MaxIncrease Then
                        MaxIncrease = PercentageChange
                        TickerMaxIncrease = TickerValue
                        
                    End If
                    
                    If PercentageChange < MaxDecrease Then
                        MaxDecrease = PercentageChange
                        TickerMaxDecrease = TickerValue
                    End If

To be clear they did not write any of the code but they did help me understand the thought process that goes behind the functionality of this snippet.
